# Process-Execution-Local-Remote-Tool
a tool that allows you to run stuff on the target's computer 
if you type the ip address
then the username,
then the password,
it will connect and there is a list of options.
it is very self explanitory just check it out yourself.

# this update feature is only for me when i want to update my entire bat/exe without restarting it
this tool is very buggy and some bugs like the update feature sometimes
bugs out when something is wrong, so it
does not work unless you actually restart the exe
